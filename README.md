## Overview

This program can both encrypt and decrypt text using AES 256-bit encryption, leveraging `System.Security.Cryptography`. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is widely used for secure data encryption.

## Features

- **AES 256 Encryption**: Encrypts text using a randomly generated key and IV.
- **AES 256 Decryption**: Decrypts text back to its original form.
- **User Input**: Allows users to choose between encryption or decryption.
- **Console Output**: Shows encrypted text in Base64 format.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE (like Visual Studio).
3. Run the program and choose either **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**.
4. Follow the prompts to input your text for encryption or decryption.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JimmyVS/AES-256-Encryption.git
